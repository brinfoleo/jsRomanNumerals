Converting Arabic Numbers to Roman Numerals


 Instructions

ðŸ‘‰ Read the Roman Numerals Kata requirements. You can find it in the following link: https://codingdojo.org/kata/RomanNumerals/ (there are many websites like Coding Dojo outlining the most popular Katas, one of them is the Roman Numerals Kata).

ðŸ‘‰ Please note that the kata â€˜cluesâ€™ section refers to some C# testing frameworks like XUnit, please ignore these.

ðŸ‘‰ Solve the Roman Numerals kata in a language of your choice. It is highly recommended you choose the language that youâ€™ll be interviewing in/your strongest programming language.

ðŸ‘‰ Please set aside to make a start on this Kata, donâ€™t worry if you donâ€™t reach a full solution as this Kata is designed for you to practise test-driven development and understand the process. We will watch and provide feedback on your 30 minute screenshare, but feel free to continue the kata afterwards outside of the recording (See the â€˜How do I make a submission? section below for the screenshare recording information).

ðŸ”Š We would like you to talk through your thinking process on the recording while you're coding; think of it like a live commentary of your reasoning on 'why' and 'how' you're going about solving the Kata. This is a common ask during tech interviews.
